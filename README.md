Hello! My name is Trooper Gothard and I am currently a high school student. Some things that interest me are electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and software engineering.<br>
Some of the projects I am currently working on include:
<ul>
  <li>A drone for the Colorado TSA competition in 2025 (see more on my website, https://gothardta.github.io)</li>
</ul>
Some projects I have previously made include:
<ul>
  <li>Connect Four Robot - you can press a button and it automatically moves to a favorable position to win or block your next move</li>
  <li>A gravity simulator - A very basic program where you can spawn planets to orbit or crash into each other</li>
  <li>Blackjack - the game blackjack written using java</li>
</ul>
